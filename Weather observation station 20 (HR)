Q) A MEDIAN is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the MEDIAN of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.
                                                                          
SELECT CAST((
(
    SELECT TOP 1 LAT_N FROM (SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT LAT_N
    FROM STATION
    WHERE LAT_N IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY LAT_N  ASC) FIRSTHALF  
ORDER BY LAT_N DESC
)
+
(
    SELECT TOP 1 LAT_N FROM (SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT LAT_N
    FROM STATION
    WHERE LAT_N IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY LAT_N  DESC) SECONDHALF
ORDER BY LAT_N ASC
)
)/2 AS DECIMAL(8,4))

>>>> EXPLAINATION !!!
eg = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
1sthalf = {1,2,3,4}
2ndhalf = {8,7,6,5}
In order to find median we take highest value from 1st half & lowest value from 2nd half
median = (4+5)/2 = 4.5

cast is used instead of round as sql server rounds the function but doesnt reduce the digits.
